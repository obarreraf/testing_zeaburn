# Deploy a Project on Zeaburn.com

The setup on Zeaburn.com is really simple. You only need to follow these steps:

1. **Create an account on Zeaburn.**
2. **Create your project on Zeaburn.**
3. **Grant permissions to allow Zeaburn to read your project files from your GitHub account.**
4. **Deploy your project.**

To view the deployed project, I recommend setting up a custom domain.

**NOTE:** The free plan only allows you to deploy a project for 24 hours.
