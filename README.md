# Deploy a Project on [Zeabur](https://www.zeabur.com)

The setup on [Zeabur](https://www.zeabur.com) is really simple. You only need to follow these steps:

1. **Create an account on Zeabur.**
2. **Create your project on Zeabur.**
3. **Grant permissions to allow Zeabur to read your project files from your GitHub account.**
4. **Deploy your project.**

To view the deployed project, I recommend setting up a custom domain.
[Public Domain](https://mcunext.zeabur.app/)

**NOTE:** The free plan only allows you to deploy a project for 24 hours.
