# Deploy a Project on [Zeaburn](https://www.zeaburn.com)

The setup on [Zeaburn](https://www.zeaburn.com) is really simple. You only need to follow these steps:

1. **Create an account on Zeaburn.**
2. **Create your project on Zeaburn.**
3. **Grant permissions to allow Zeaburn to read your project files from your GitHub account.**
4. **Deploy your project.**

To view the deployed project, I recommend setting up a custom domain.
[Public Domain] (https://mcunext.zeabur.app/)

**NOTE:** The free plan only allows you to deploy a project for 24 hours.
